### Work Experience
### Application Data Systems, Inc. Hernando MS
Director 
CAD Software Development 
October 1995 - Present 

Develop, maintain, train and support Public Safety Software.

My current responsibility is our Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) software. I developed our current CAD Software in PHP using CodeIgniter Framework connected to a MySQL Database.  For phase one,  portions of CAD were still maintained in COBOL programming for various reasons. I developed routines for PHP to communicate with Linux message queues over TCP_IP, which the COBOL utilizes for internal messaging. In moving the software to a web based environment, it needed to keep up with 911 calls and Police_Fire equipment real-time. I used AJAX to do this (Prototype java script library). This gave us the ability to communicate with the database and keep the user‚Äôs screen updated with the latest information as it becomes available.  We also integrated ArcGIS REST Services to include maps for users to see both live and historical call info as well as live GPS data.  Other interfaces include Priority Dispatch ProQA softeware, Power Phone,  email interfaces to send call information to phones and pagers, interface to 911 CADI data.

For the second phase, the legacy COBOL parts were replaced with web-based components.  We also moved from AJAX polling calls to true web sockets for communication.  

For phase three, the plan is to move the product from CodeIginiter Framework to Laravel, as well as adding two-factor and LDAP support.

Prior to this, I developed our Police Records Management System. This software was originally developed in COBOL. I worked on a team that updated this software to make it ‚ÄúY2K‚Äù compliant. Afterwards, I worked on moving the software from terminal based to a Windows Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Visual Basic 5 as the front end and using libraries developed by a coworker, communicating to the COBOL backend. During this time, I also created and implemented the ‚ÄúMast Name System‚Äù to store all persons entered anywhere in the system in one central location. Next I was the lead developer_supervisor that moved the software away from COBOL_Visual Basic to a web based program using PHP and Java Script(AJAX). I used a database library under PEAR to connect the software to a variety of database options, including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL.
